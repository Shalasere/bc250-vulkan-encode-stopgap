"""
bc250_lab_parse.py - the ONE parser for this driver's instrumentation logs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The per-stage numbers in docs/DEVLOG.md §19-§21 were produced by about a
dozen throwaway awk one-liners, each re-deriving the same parse. That went
wrong in ways that cost real time: one of them sorted its input and destroyed
chronological order (making a fix look like it worked when it had not), and
several reported a mean without any measure of spread, which is how a 0.4%
"win" gets written down next to a 6% run-to-run variance.

So: one parser, one place to fix a bug, and it always reports spread
alongside the mean.

INPUT   ffmpeg stderr from a run with BC250_PERF_STATS=1, which carries the
        driver's [BC250_PERF_FRAME] / [BC250_PERF_CPU] / [BC250_PERF_SHADOW] /
        [BC250_PERF_GPU] / [BC250_NZ_AUDIT] lines.
OUTPUT  a single flat JSON object of metrics (default) or one TSV row.

Every timing metric emits three keys: <name> (mean), <name>_sd (sample
standard deviation) and <name>_n (sample count). A mean with n=1 and no sd is
reported as sd=0.0, which is honest but should not be mistaken for precision -
use `bc250_lab.sh noise` to establish the floor before believing any delta.

    # `-g` looks like a performance change.

    # cavlc_ms was not, which pooled an 8 ms I-frame with 3.5 ms P-frames and
    # produced a negative `unaccounted_ms`. Hence the rule, applied to every

    # wait_sync can legitimately be far smaller than execution time.
