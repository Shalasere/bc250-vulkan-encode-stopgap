 * bs_write_zeros - Write `count` consecutive 0 bits as a single bs_write_u()
 * call instead of `count` separate single-bit calls.
 *
 * PERF (found via gprof profiling of a standalone harness driving this
 * file's real functions with realistic quantized-coefficient statistics,
 * 2026-09): cavlc_write_one_level()'s unary level_prefix coding used to do
 * `for (p = 0; p < count; p++) bs_write_bit(bs, 0);` - i.e. one full
 * bs_write_u() call (function call across a translation-unit boundary, so
 * not inlinable at -O2 without LTO, plus its own internal branch and a
 * byte read-modify-write) PER SINGLE BIT of the unary prefix. Profiling
 * 1,000,000 synthetic macroblocks (27M blocks, realistic mixed nC/magnitude/
 * total_coeff statistics) showed 530.7 MILLION bs_write_u() calls total
 * (~530/MB) with cavlc_write_one_level() alone responsible for 122.7M calls
 * into it - almost entirely these per-bit unary loops, since a real block's
 * levels routinely need several bits of unary prefix (0-13 zero bits before
 * the terminating 1, per ITU-T 9.2.2.1's level_prefix). bs_write_u() already
 * supports writing an arbitrary bit-width value in one call (chunked
 * internally by byte, not by bit - see its own implementation), and this
 * exact "write a whole zero run as one call" pattern was already used
 * successfully by bs_write_ue() for its Exp-Golomb zero run - it just wasn't
 * applied here. Writing `count` zero bits as ONE bs_write_u(bs, count, 0)
 * call produces IDENTICAL output bytes to `count` individual bs_write_u(bs,
 * 1, 0) calls (both write exactly `count` 0-bits, MSB-first, at the same
 * stream position) - this is a pure call-count reduction, not a behavior
 * change. See this commit's message for board-measured before/after
 * throughput.

 * message for the full methodology, including a 3-way GT/GPU-recon/decoded
 * comparison that proved the GPU reconstruction chain - transform, quantize,
 * dequantize, IDCT, intra/inter prediction, deblocking - was already correct
 * to ~50dB, isolating the defect to entropy coding, plus a byte-for-byte diff
 * of every VLC table in this file against ffmpeg's libavcodec/h264_cavlc.c
 * that came back clean, narrowing it to this function's own iteration order):
 *
 * runs[] is populated by cavlc_scan_coeffs() as runs[j] = the zero-run
 * immediately preceding the (j+1)-th coefficient IN HIGHEST-TO-LOWEST
 * FREQUENCY RANK ORDER (rank 0 = highest frequency, matching levels[]'s own
 * ordering - see that function's doc comment), for j = 0 .. total_coeff-2
 * (the lowest-frequency/closest-to-DC coefficient's own preceding run is
 * folded into total_zeros directly, per that function's comment, and is
 * never coded as a separate run_before).
 *
 * Per ITU-T H.264 9.2.3 - and confirmed against ffmpeg's decode_residual()
 * STORE_BLOCK macro, which decodes run_before values in a plain
 * `for (i = 1; i < total_coeff && zeros_left > 0; i++)` loop, i.e. reads the
 * run before rank-1 (second-highest frequency) FIRST and the run before
 * rank-(total_coeff-1) (lowest frequency) LAST - run_before is coded
 * HIGHEST-to-LOWEST frequency, the same direction as coeff_token/levels.
 *
 * This function used to iterate `for (i = total_coeff-1; i > 0; i--)`, i.e.
 * runs[i-1] for i counting DOWN from total_coeff-1 to 1 - which visits
 * runs[total_coeff-2] (the LOWEST-frequency run) FIRST and runs[0] (the
 * second-highest-frequency run) LAST: exactly BACKWARDS from what a
 * spec-compliant decoder reads. For total_coeff <= 2 there is only ever one
 * run_before value, so the bug was invisible (order of one element doesn't
 * matter) - which is exactly why the flat/DC-dominated and simple-edge
 * surgical round-trip tests earlier in this investigation (almost always
 * total_coeff 0-2 per block) came back clean while real, busy content
 * (color-bar/edge-rich test patterns, routinely total_coeff >= 3 per luma
 * AC block) came back at ~15.5dB luma PSNR: every block with 3+ nonzero
 * coefficients had its run_before values coded in reversed order, which is
 * still perfectly valid CAVLC syntax (same token set, same total_zeros, same
 * total run length) - hence ffmpeg reporting "0 decode errors" - but places
 * every affected coefficient at the WRONG scan position once decoded,
 * scrambling energy between frequency bands. Chroma uses this same function
 * for its AC blocks, but 4:2:0-subsampled/smoother chroma content hits
 * total_coeff >= 3 far less often than luma, which is why chroma PSNR
 * (~29dB) was far less degraded than luma (~15.5dB) despite sharing this
 * exact code path - not because chroma has a separate, correct
 * implementation.
